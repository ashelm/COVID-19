### Project Overview
COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The disease was first identified in 2019 in Wuhan, China, and has since spread globally, resulting in the 2019â€“20 coronavirus pandemic. Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath. Muscle pain, sputum production and sore throat are less common. The rate of deaths per number of diagnosed cases is on average 3.4%, ranging from 0.2% in those less than 20 to approximately 15% in those over 80 years old. This project aims to analyze COVID-19 data from various countries to understand patterns, trends, and differences in the spread and impact of the virus. The analysis is based on data obtained from the 2019 Novel Coronavirus COVID-19 Data Repository by Johns Hopkins CSSE.
